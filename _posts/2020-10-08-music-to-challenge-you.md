title: Music To Challenge You
---

The act of listening is the act of reasoning. Passive listening practices strengthens passive reasoning.

When listening to recorded music, the affect it has on the reader pulls them along in some direction. It can be any forcefulness in any direction across the planes of emotion, physical response, and inwards-ness. Music takes you on a journey, as they say.

You, the sailor in the rough sea, gazes out to your territorial bounds, and finds the waves fierce. “To adventure!” You say as you embark forward. Or “To hell with that!” as you retreat.

Music To Challenge You, I’ll call it. An approaching wave that your boat was not built for. So why not build a surfboard, and find sustenance through the joy of surfing?

Sometimes your board will lift and drop gently and smoothly, as you cascade down the perfect crest. Other times you will be plummeted forward, body dragged along by a cord attached to the board, gasping for air when you might. But you will always get up and that experience will shape you. Some days you may not have any waves at all - but you are still on your board in the middle of the sea and isn’t that peacefulness something to behold? Doesn’t it explain the waves?

These experiences provide you a context into how other people surf, why they surf, and how it is one of the things that makes them tick tick tick along.

Give yourself to the waves and live freely in the water.

What really is the act of observing causation and applying meaning to it? Did the new houseplant disappear because you figure your cat ate it? How do you know you have a cat? This is what reasoning is.

Through reasoning we define ourselves and find ourselves in the world. Let’s talk about these reasonings as nodes. Music, as in, music that music reaches to be, is the connections between those nodes.

Now what is passive reasoning? It’s letting reasoning envelop you without any interjection to yourself. It’s accepting, trusting, and absorbing the reasoning in the experiences of your life. “You and your stomach!” as Nietzsche might interrupt me to say. By not questioning the process of reasoning, we end up with a feedback loop of reasoning, resulting in hateful, divisive, or obsessive compulsiveness. If these ‘nodes’ are rooted in the self, and music is the connection of those nodes, then what is passive listening?

Passive listening strengthens the nodes of reason without any question, opposition, or friction. Through active listening, there is stronger friction into considering what is right and what is wrong. And through this friction we can develop our morals and our loving minds. Many listener’s of today will either passively listen or passively reject without any question. Sometimes this is based in moral goodness (see PLUR) but it is narrow and temperamental.

As you step out into the world (or step in) try to engage deeply and fondly with listening. If the thought comes to tell you that some sound is right or some sound is wrong (is the car alarm outside your window annoying you?) think critically and think with less of your human-ness. Listen to the nuance as you realize your projections into the sounds you find. You find yourself, don’t you?

I promise you - the waves are super nice today.
