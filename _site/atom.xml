   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/a-thousand-plateaus&quot;&gt;A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Gilles Deleuze&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Félix Guattari&lt;/em&gt;. This work is about modes of knowledge and rhizomatic philosphy. Particularly, the multiplicities of being that is shared among us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hidden deep beneath our higher level operating state of perceived causation, is a network of connections that binds us and our things to all other things. And where we end up finding ourselves, is no where but in the connections, rooted to a greater system of entropy and decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rhizome, an organic structure of all the organic, mutable in state but immutable in process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now.. how is this state of being communicated and observed? I think it’s through music (or from a more spiritual terminology, the reach for music).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lespressesdureel.com/EN/ouvrage.php?id=8071&quot;&gt;The Music to Come&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;François J. Bonnet&lt;/em&gt; states that music is not in fact music, but it’s an avatar for itself. Music as it exists and is experienced, is a grasp at the unconscious grasping at its connections. Music, the one that we hear, is an idea, or rather a notation, of the music that exists in this space, the rhizome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you closed your eyes and imagined the feeling you get from that particular piece of music? Is that feeling tangible in the music itself, or is it engendered with you, the listener? Is that feeling discretely limited to transciptions of notation, or the conversations about notation? Is it rules that are followed or broken?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider the relationship between the creator(s) and the instruments. Is that feeling a derivitive of that one and only permutation? Is it universally shared or is it a perceived structure from the vast nothingness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I turn this over to myself, and look inside me to find what is true, I do agree that music is an avatar, a rendering, for the idea of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding Music Theory and the common modern music. The most common forms of ‘music avatars’ today are expressions of Imperialism and the western capitalist movement. Music theory, ‘how to do music and how not to do it’, are direct reflections on (particularly white) history, rather than free emphatic expression. For example, the strict music structure engendered by the genre of Electronic Dance Music is a gesture of a reward of a product, placed in a historical context (which might happen to be now). This ‘product’ being the listener’s expectations and predictions, exposed without challenge or remorse, rising and falling without actually rising and falling. I will not comment on the measure of value of this genre, that is another discussion entirely, but I would like to address the lack of vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be truly expressive is to be vulnerable. The musical gestures of strict alignment and structure do not embrace vulnerability, but a system of security, familiarity and expectation matching. This is not inherently better or worse, but it is product of product and is defined by a value that cannot be applied universally. Not that dance music can’t be vulnerable (in fact it can be extremely vulnerable..), but the trend I see today is to move away from vulnerability. Is this a reflection of our zeitgeist?&lt;/p&gt;
